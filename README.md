# CNN MNIST 

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- Customizable CNN architecture with variable convolutional blocks, filter sizes, and activation functions.
- Preprocessing pipeline to normalize and reshape MNIST data for training and testing.
- Fully connected output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
